# Deck Image Viewer (quantity-aware)

Next.js + Vercel app that shows Pokemon TCG deck **JPG** images on one page.
If a card has a quantity badge (e.g., Ã—2), the same image is duplicated that many times.

## Local Dev
```bash
npm i
npm run dev # http://localhost:3000
```

## Deploy
- Push to GitHub, import to Vercel as Next.js (Node runtime).
